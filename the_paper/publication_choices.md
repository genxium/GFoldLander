According to this guide from [gssrr](https://gssrr.org/), there're a few low cost & low bar journal to choose from. However, the whole `gssrr` is included in [this list also lists some bad journals to avoid](https://beallslist.net/). The term `APC` stands for `article processing charge` which includes "peer review fee" but might not include the publication fee.

- [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/)
    - Free of charge for both review and publication, but [requires endorser in the relevant field for the first publication](https://arxiv.org/help/endorsement).
    - Unknown cycle of review, possibly field specific.  

- [ICCRE](http://www.iccre.org/)
    - Very expensive charge even just for [registration(up to 560 USD)](http://www.iccre.org/registration.html).
    - Cycle of review is around 1 month.
